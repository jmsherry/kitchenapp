As you can see from the badges the project uses CI service at Codeship (Travis is hooked up for practice) Coverage (istanbul) is used through gulp and reported via Code Climate. e2e as a service is to be handled by Saucelabs.\r\n\r\nTo populate the database with some initial ingredients and recipes type `$ seed` (N.B. it will blow away all the data in your current collections).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
