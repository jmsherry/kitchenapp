Kitchenapp is a MEAN (Mongodb [with Mongoose ODM], Express js, Angular and Node) stack demo created using the bangular yeoman template.

Use `gulp` to run in development and `gulp preview` to run the optimised project. `gulp test` will allow you to run the tests (which are currently locked to a limited set for demo purposes) and you can specify whether to test the client or serverside code by adding the flag `--server` or `--client`.
